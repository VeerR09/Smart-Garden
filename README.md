# Smart-Garden
My mom has a garden. I was curious, what if I make it a smart garden? How hard is it to do, and how useful will it actually be? I guess I'll find out.

I'm gonna log my progress using README updates, I'll make a folder of dates older "log entries" or whatever to go through for my own use, or if you care for some reason. I wanted to see how hard it would be, assuming this is a marketable idea, to make this scalable. I'm going to do my best to build this project with scalability in mind. 

What exactly am I doing? I'm thinking a little pod you can plop down in a garden, it gathers various sensor readings and sends them over to a little receiver which will then conveniently collect and show you important information about your garden on a nice dashboard. This dashboard will be accessible like any other website and it will also recommend watering schedules for your plants. I'll get to recommended watering schedules later, for now I just want to make the system of collecting and viewing sensor data. 

So let's see how this goes, I'm going to start with my backend stuff like database and some APIs along with a basic frontend to test everything. Once I have this structure set up I'm going to order all the parts I need and start working on setting up all the physical components, then finish off with polishing the dashboard and making it live so anyone can interact with it.

Thanks for reading, good luck future me.
